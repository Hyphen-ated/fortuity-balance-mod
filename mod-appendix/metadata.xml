Full change log: http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page

* Fixed multiple game bugs.
* Weak weapons made relevantly cheaper or otherwise improved. Best weapons slightly more expensive, Flak I less common.
* Many events tweaked to make more options actually worth considering.
* Stealth C's Shield+ Drone now requires 1 power; Engi B starts with Level 3 Piloting; Rock A starts with Explosive Replicator; Fed C starts with Repair Burst.
* Most augments improved or made cheaper. Adv. FTL Navigation removed from game. Long-Ranged Scanners cost more.
* Shield Drones now require 2 power and cost less. Fire Drone, Beam II, and Anti-Combat Drones have been buffed slightly. Defense II and Combat II cheaper.
* System Pricing: Hacking much more expensive, Teleporters cheaper. Many systems cheaper at the highest levels (including Engines). Doors cheaper (for Rock B), cheaper to switch Medbay and Clone Bay.
* Reduced the odds of free crew from events slightly and tweaked many event scrap gains up or down appropriately.
* Various quality of life tweaks: easier beam aiming, more consistent event option ordering, better default weapon/crew positions, etc.
* Fixed visuals on all ships, including shield positioning/size, cloaking lines, and system graphics.
* Large number of punctuation and grammar fixes. Event phrasing tweaked to be more consistent and clear. Tooltips give exact breach/fire chance.
